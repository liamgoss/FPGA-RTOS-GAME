 *
 * OSMutexPend Function:
		Parameters:
			- OS_EVENT *pevent: Pointer to the mutex control block.
			- INT16U timeout: The maximum amount of time (in ticks) the task is willing to wait for the mutex. Use 0 for no timeout (wait indefinitely).
			- INT8U *perr: Pointer to an INT8U variable where the error code will be stored.
		Description:
			- OSMutexPend is used by a task to request ownership of a mutex.
			- If the mutex is available (not owned by another task), the task obtains ownership immediately.
			- If the mutex is already owned by another task, the calling task may wait for it to become available, depending on the specified timeout.
			- If timeout is 0, the task waits indefinitely until the mutex becomes available.
			- If timeout is non-zero, the task waits for the specified time, and if the mutex is not available within that time, it returns with an error.

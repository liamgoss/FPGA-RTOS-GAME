# FPGA-RTOS-GAME
The objective of this project is to develop a two player game running on the Micrium (µC) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). Each player uses their respective side of the host computer’s keyboard to control their player. Our deliverables will be composed of the various modules offered by the Intel Qsys Platform Designer.
